The repo contains the R script run_analysis.R that does the following: a) merges the training and the test sets of UCI HAR dataset to create one data set. b) extracts the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. c) uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. d) creates a second, independent tidy data td2.txt set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The repo contains also the td2.txt data set.
